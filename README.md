# Master in AI 

In this repository, I present some of my works related with Artificial Intelligence at University of LÃ¼beck, during my Master in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. I would like to thank all of my teachers and lab teammates.

Courses: **Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Medical Deep Learning**


## Machine Learning

1. PCA, ICA and Sparse Coding

    Three unsupervised methods are applied: Prinicipal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Sparse Coding (SC).

    Dataset: MNIST - handwritten images and faces.
2. Manifold Learning 

    Multi-dimensional Scaling and Isomap algorithm are implemented. 
    Dataset: Swiss roll.

3. Statistical Learning Theory 

    K-nearest-neighbor algorithm is implemented for a two-class classification problem on a two-dimensional dataset.

4. Boosting 

    Adaptive boosting algorithm is implemented to combine multiple weak classification models and form one strong classifier for a two-class classification problem on a two-dimensional dataset.

5. Random Forests

    Random forest algorithm is implemented to combine multiple decision trees to one strong classifier for a multi-class classification problem on a two-dimensional dataset.


## Computer Vision 

0. Introduction to Python


* Basic Python: Basic data types (Containers, Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples), Functions, Classes
* Numpy: Arrays, Array indexing, Datatypes, Array math, Broadcasting
* Matplotlib: Plotting, Subplots, Images
* IPython: Creating notebooks, Typical workflows

1. Imaging - Histograms


* Image gradients
* Compute and display histograms
* Underexposed, darker, images that have been exposed to too little light
* Overexposed, brighter, images that have been exposed to too much light
* Histogram equalization, logarithmic and quadratic functions


2. Image Acquisition, Optics

* Thin lenses, focal length, focus
* The influence of the focal length
* The influence of the aperture
* Conversion between pixel and camera coordinates, Time-of-flight (ToF) camera

3. Image Center, Edges, Keypoints

* Finding the image center 
* Edge detection, show image gradients
* Canny edge detector
* Key point detection by using the Structure Tensor J and the Hassian Matrix H

4. Greedy Snake 

* Use the gradient magnitude as image term
* Calculate the three energy terms $E_{cont}$, $E_{curv}$, $E_{imag}$
* Normalize the energy terms over the neighborhood to the intervall $[0, 1]$
* Estimate the point in the neighborhood, that has minimum energy
